Hi I have done some editions: I leave the custom pulse section for now because we may not use them due to the timing issue as you have mentioned, instead I modified the pulse train. According to your codes we can select four parameters: amplitude, pulse width, period(interval between two pulses), and the total duration. I therefore added the entry section for each of these parameters. Another change I made was I added two stimulate buttons, one sends command using the pulse train while the other one sends custom pulse. This is because if we have inputs in both sections (pulse train and custom pulse) it can be hard to distinguish which command we want to send. Both buttons will be mute during the time signals are being sent. the stimulate button for pulse train we use now is using sendPulseSignal function which includes all the rehamove related codes - since I cannot test it, and since the frequency is very high that I cannot use "print" to test. You may need to check the codes before running it.
